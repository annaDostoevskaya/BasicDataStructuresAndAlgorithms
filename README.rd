Make this is «project» i  want show my work.
I learn Data Structure last 3-4 week, and after
very careful study i push this in Git.

I can't show structure type of Linked List or
any "easy" data structure, but I push structures 
that is a bit interesting.

1) Trees.
    There are only some of them(BTS, RBT, B-tree)
2) Graphs.
3) Hash Tables.
4) Dynamic Programming
    I understand that this is paradigm...
    
I also push in folder "anyCode" another pieces
which I wrote when just-just start.


Thank.
